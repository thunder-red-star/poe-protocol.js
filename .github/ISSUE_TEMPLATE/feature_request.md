# You there, with the great idea! Tell us more...  
We want to hear your brilliant thoughts for new features to add to the poe-protocol.js library! We're always looking to improve the experience for our users, and your feature idea could be just the enhancement we need.

## Lay it on us!
Dazzle us with details about your vision for this new feature. How would it work? What problems would it solve? What amazing things could users achieve with it? We want all the juicy details. Our feature inspiration meters are standing by!
## Why so serious? 
Convince us why your feature is the best thing since sliced fairy bread. How would it improve life for protocol users around the world? Don't hold back on examples and use cases - help us see the light! The more persuasive you are the faster we'll get to work. 
## Care to suggest an API?
If you have thoughts on how your invention could actually work at an API level, feel free to suggest some possibilities. Function names, arguments, returns - we welcome it all! Creative ideas get bonus points, and pull requests get all the points!
## Considered any alternatives? 
Before demanding we add your feature, did you try any duct tape solutions or hacks to get the job done? If so, tell us about them so we understand the problem fully. We don't want to build what can already be cobbled together!
## Any other deets? 
Anything else you'd like us to know? We're all ears (or eyes in this case). Speak now or forever hold your peace!

Thank you oh visionary one for your feature request and efforts to improve our experience! Your idea will be given top priority for review by our dev team over a round of butterbeers. Get ready to change the world!
